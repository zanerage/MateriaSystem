Materia System - Inspired by Final Fantasy VII
This Unity project showcases a Materia System inspired by the classic RPG, Final Fantasy VII.
It focuses on implementing an interactive system where players can manage and equip Materia to weapons or armor, replicating the depth of equipment customization found in modern RPGs. Below are the key features of this project:

• Materia Drag and Drop System: Allows users to drag and drop Materia items from an inventory into weapon and armor slots.
• Fully functional UI-based drag-and-drop mechanics using Unity's UI Toolkit.

• Equipment Integration: Materia can be attached to weapons and armor, updating both the visual representation and underlying data.
• Weapon and Armor Scriptable Objects: Weapons and armor are managed using ScriptableObjects, allowing for flexibility and easy data persistence.

• Slot Compatibility System: Each Materia has specific types (e.g., Magic, Support) that determine its compatibility with different slots.
• Dynamic Slot Updating: When Materia is dropped into a slot, the slot is dynamically updated to reflect the change, including the Materia type and its effect.

• User-Friendly UI: The equipment and inventory UI have been carefully designed to be intuitive and easy to use.
• Empty Slot Indicators: Slots are labeled with "Empty Slot" until filled, providing a clear user experience.

• ScriptableObject-Based Inventory System: Materia items are defined using ScriptableObjects for easy reuse and extension.

How to Use

• Clone the repository and open it in Unity.
• Drag and drop Materia from the inventory into compatible weapon or armor slots to equip them.
• The equipment and inventory UI updates automatically to reflect these changes.

Future Improvements

• Expand the Materia Types: More complex interactions between different Materia types.
• Visual Feedback Enhancements: Additional animations or effects when equipping or swapping Materia.
• Sprite Integration: Adding visual representations of each Materia type for enhanced user experience.

Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the system as you wish. Contributions are welcome!
